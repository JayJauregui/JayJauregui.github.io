        <p>
            As AI becomes more prevalent with every passing day, it raises several important ethical questions.
            <br>
            Who do we blame when AI goes wrong? How do we make sure it's unbiased, fair and safe?
        </p>
       <p> 
        The blind use of Artificial Intelligence is a slippery slope. If unchecked, it can lead to biased, confusing and outright completely wrong responses.
        <br><br>
        Plenty of companies in the year 2025 are using AI to sometimes outright deny or accept job applications, fire workers and of course, replace human workers.
        </p>
        <p>Although it can be argued that these jobs that AI are replacing aren't important or needed enough
            for a human to get paid for doing it. It's still dangerous and depressing as it's still kicking humans with financial needs and even familes
            to provide for and replacing them with AI.
        </p>

        <p>
                        To ask the question again, who do we blame for a dangerous wrong answer or if a self-driven car were to crash and injure an individual?
                        <br>
                        Do we blame:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
            <li> The developer </li>
            <li> The company that implemented it</li>
            <li>The AI</li>
            
            </ul>

        </p>
