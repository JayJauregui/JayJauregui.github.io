        <p>
        Machine learning is the act of allowing Artificial Intelligence to learn from massive amounts of data for it to "learn" and improve over time.
        Machine learning requires time and effort for it to be right. To follow patterns to make the right predictions and decisions.
        </p>
        Some use cases for Machine learning would be:
        <ul>
        <li>ChatGPT</li>
        <li> Self-Driving cars to learn and recognize street signs, obstacles and pedestrians</li>
        <li> Streaming apps like Hulu, Netflix, Spotify and Youtube that give recommendations based on the user's likes and dislikes</li>
        <li>House pricing evaluators</li>


        </ul>
